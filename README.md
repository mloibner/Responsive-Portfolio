# Responsive-Portfolio
Home Work - Week 2


I have completed my responsive portfolio with the last 2 pages to be work in progress. I have not yet learned about adding PHP files to enable submission of forms to an email address. I do not believe my computer is configured for this yet so I need to research that more. I also have a section free for a new project in the projects page which is something I will be working on in my own time to upgrade.
